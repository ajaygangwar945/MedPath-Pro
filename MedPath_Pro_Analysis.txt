PROJECT TITLE: MedPath Pro - Hospital Shortest Path Visualizer
SUBTITLE: Streamlining Healthcare Logistics with Graph Theory

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
MedPath Pro is an interactive web-based simulator designed to optimize the 
transportation of patients to medical facilities. It provides a visual 
platform where users can model real-world street networks, hospital locations, 
and patient positions. By visualizing shortest paths, the application 
demonstrates how data-driven decisions can save critical time during 
medical emergencies.

2. CORE ALGORITHM: DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
The application is powered by Dijkstra's Algorithm, a fundamental graph 
traversal algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in 
a graph.

How it works in MedPath Pro:
- Nodes: Represent Hospitals or Patients (Users).
- Edges: Represent roads or paths connecting them.
- Weights: Represent distances or travel times between locations.
- The Algorithm: Starting from a specific patient, it explores every 
  possible route, keeping track of the minimum "cost" to reach every 
  hospital, ensuring the absolute shortest path is found.

3. USES & APPLICATIONS OF DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM
Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used across various industries:
- GPS & Navigation: Found in apps like Google Maps for routing vehicles.
- Logistics: Used for supply chain optimization and delivery routing.
- Network Routing: Directs data packets across the internet to minimize latency.
- Infrastructure Planning: Designing efficient power grids and water pipelines.
- Robotics: Helps autonomous robots navigate paths while avoiding obstacles.

4. PROJECT FUNCTIONALITIES
The application offers several interactive features for a full simulation:

A. Dynamic Map Building:
- Add Users (Patients) and Hospitals by clicking anywhere on a 2D canvas.
- Create Edges (Roads) between nodes and assign custom weights (Distances).

B. Real-Time Pathfinding:
- One-click execution of the shortest path calculation.
- Instant visual highlighting of the optimal route in cyan.

C. Hospital Resource Management (Portal):
- Every hospital has a private "Dashboard" to manage bed availability.
- Bed counts are updated in real-time as patients are admitted.

D. Integrated Notification System:
- Patients can "Notify" the nearest hospital via the sidebar.
- Hospitals receive alerts and can "Approve" incoming patients.
- Approval triggers a high-fidelity "Flow" animation along the shortest path.

E. Interactive Demo Data:
- Pre-built medical networks to showcase complex routing scenarios immediately.

5. TECHNICAL & OTHER DETAILS
A. Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism, CSS Variables).
- Graphics: Canvas API (2D Rendering), Three.js (3D Animated Background).
- Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for algorithm implementation and UI state.
- Documentation: Detailed JSDoc comments for every function and section.

B. Visual Design:
- Modern Medical Aesthetic: Clean white and teal color palette.
- Immersive 3D: A floating particle network represents the "Neural" 
  connection of healthcare data.
- User Experience: Non-blocking toast notifications and bouncy modal 
  animations for a premium feel.

C. Live Access:
- Deployment: Hosted via GitHub Pages.
